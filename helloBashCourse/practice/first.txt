The Unix operating system popularized the notion of separating the shell (the
 adding text at very at 4th line of the file
part of the system that lets you type commands) from everything else: the
input/output system, the scheduler, memory management, and all of the other
things the operating system takes care of for you (and that most users donâ€™t
want to care about). The shell was just one more program; it was a program
whose job was executing other programs on behalf of users.
